 [//]: # (### What is a Function Definition?)

A function definition is a block of code that specifies the actions performed by a function. It includes the function's return type, name, parameters (if any), and the code that gets executed when the function is called.

Here's an example of a simple function definition in C++:

```cpp
// Function definition
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

This function is named `add`, it takes two parameters (`a` and `b`) of type `int`, and it returns an `int`. The function adds the values of `a` and `b` together and returns the result using the `return` statement.

Function definitions in C++ can be declared in various places within a program, including within classes (making them member functions) or in the global scope.
