[//]: # (###Passing Arguments by Reference)

Passing arguments by reference in C++ allows you to modify the original variables within a function. This is helpful when you want to alter the values of variables directly without making copies, improving efficiency and allowing changes to persist outside the function.

Here's an example demonstrating passing arguments by reference:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Function that modifies values using references
void modifyValues(int& a, int& b) {
    a *= 2; // Multiply 'a' by 2
    b += 5; // Add 5 to 'b'
}

int main() {
    int num1 = 10;
    int num2 = 7;

    std::cout << "Before modification: num1 = " << num1 << ", num2 = " << num2 << std::endl;

    // Pass variables by reference to modifyValues function
    modifyValues(num1, num2);

    std::cout << "After modification: num1 = " << num1 << ", num2 = " << num2 << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `modifyValues` takes two integers `a` and `b` by reference (`int&`). When `modifyValues` is called in `main()` with `num1` and `num2`, any changes made to `a` and `b` inside the function directly affect `num1` and `num2` in the `main()` function.

After calling `modifyValues`, `num1` is modified by doubling its value (`num1 *= 2`) and `num2` is modified by adding 5 to its value (`num2 += 5`). The changes made within the function are reflected in the variables `num1` and `num2` when printed in `main()`.

Passing arguments by reference is advantageous when you want to modify variables within a function and have those changes reflected in the original variables. It's particularly useful for functions that need to alter multiple values or modify the original variables directly without creating copies.
