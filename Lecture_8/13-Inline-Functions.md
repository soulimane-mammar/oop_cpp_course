[//]: # (### Inline Functions)

Inline functions in C++ are a way to suggest to the compiler that a function's code should be inserted directly into the calling code rather than performing a regular function call. This suggestion serves as an optimization strategy to potentially save the overhead of a function call, especially for small and frequently used functions.

To declare a function as inline, you use the `inline` keyword in its declaration:

```cpp
inline int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

When the `add` function is marked as `inline` and called in your code, the compiler may decide to insert the function's code at the calling location instead of generating a separate function call. This can reduce the overhead associated with the function call itself, such as pushing arguments onto the stack and managing the return address.

However, the `inline` keyword is more of a suggestion to the compiler rather than a command. The compiler ultimately decides whether to inline the function based on various factors, including the size of the function, the optimization level, and whether it believes inlining would be beneficial.

#### Benefits of Inline Functions

- **Performance Improvement:** Reduces the overhead of function calls, especially for small functions.
- **Avoids Function Call Stack Operations:** Helps eliminate the overhead of pushing arguments and managing the return address.

#### Considerations

- **Code Size:** Inlining can increase code size if used excessively or with larger functions.
- **Debugging:** Inlining may affect the debugging experience, making it harder to trace function calls.
