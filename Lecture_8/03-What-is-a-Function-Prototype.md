[//]: # (### What is a Function Prototype)

A function prototype in C++ is a declaration that provides the necessary information about a function to the compiler before the actual function definition. It specifies the function's name, return type, and parameters without implementing the function's body.

#### Syntax of a Function Prototype

```cpp
return_type function_name(parameter1_type, parameter2_type, ...);
```

#### Example of a Function Prototype

```cpp
// Function prototype for a simple addition function
int add(int a, int b);
```

#### Purpose of Function Prototypes

1. **Informing the Compiler:** The primary purpose of a function prototype is to inform the compiler about the existence, return type, and parameters of a function before it's used in the program.
  
2. **Enable Compilation:** Function prototypes allow functions to be used before their actual definitions in the code. This is especially important when functions are defined after they are used, as the compiler needs to know the function's signature beforehand.

#### Benefits of Using Function Prototypes

- **Avoids Implicit Declarations:** In C++, if a function is used before it's defined or if there's no prototype, the compiler implicitly assumes the function's signature based on its usage, which can lead to potential issues.
- **Enables Early Detection of Errors:** Prototypes help catch mismatched function calls or incorrect argument types at compile time, reducing runtime errors.
- **Supports Modularization:** Function prototypes promote modularity by allowing functions to be declared in header files, facilitating code organization and separation of interface from implementation.
