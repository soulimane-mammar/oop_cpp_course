Functions give you a way to compartmentalize and organize a programâ€™s execution logic.

They enable you to split the contents of an application into logical blocks that are invoked sequentially.

A function is a subprogram that optionally takes parameters and returns a value, and it needs to be invoked to perform its task.

In this lesson you learn

- The need for programming functions
- Function prototypes and function definition
- Passing parameters to functions and returning values from them
- Overloading functions
- Recursive functions
- Lambda functions
