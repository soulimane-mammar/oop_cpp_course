C++ is often used for its simplicity and OOP facility. Other reasons to use
this language are as follows:

#### C++ Features

- Clear and straightforward syntax: Because it is derived from C, the syntax is akin and straightforward to comprehend.

- Object-oriented: OOP features like polymorphism, inheritance,
encapsulation, and abstraction are used.

- Object-oriented: OOP features such as polymorphism, inheritance, encapsulation, and abstraction are employed.

- Memory management capabilities: C++ supports dynamic memory allocation.

- Versatile programming capabilities: C++ can handle both low-level programming tasks, such as drivers and kernels, as well as high-level applications like games, GUI, and desktop apps.

- Extensive libraries: C++ provides access to a wide array of built-in functions and libraries, which can significantly save time and effort.

- Compiler-based: Your C++ program must successfully pass through the compilation stage before it can be executed.

- Structural programming language: Your code is modular, i.e., consisting
of functions, classes, and objects.

- Structured programming language: Your code is organized in a modular fashion, comprising functions, classes, and objects.

#### Who Uses Programs Written in C++?

The list of applications, operating systems, interpreters, web services, databases, and enterprise software applications developed in C++ is extensive. Regardless of who you are or how you utilize computing resources, it's highly likely that you are using software written in C++. For instance, the V8 JavaScript Engine, developed by Google, is coded in C++. This engine plays a crucial role in popular web browsers and server technologies like Node.js.

C++ is the preferred language for research endeavors undertaken by physicists, mathematicians, and data scientists. The surge in artificial intelligence, driven by machine learning algorithms, owes much of its success to the high-performance computing capabilities provided by C++.
