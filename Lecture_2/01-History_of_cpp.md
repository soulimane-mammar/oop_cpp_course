In 1980, Bjarne Stroustrup, a Danish Computer Scientist employed at AT&T Bell Labs in Murray Hill, New Jersey, developed  C++, a programming language that incorporated elements from C and Simula67 while also embracing Object Oriented Programming (OOP). Initially, the language was named "C with Classes" because Stroustrup's primary goal was to leverage classes for the implementation of OOP characteristics.

In 1983, Bjarne Stroustrup released "The C++ Programming Language," which marked the birth of the C++ language as we know it today. It introduced the name "C++" and included the first version of the language with features like classes, inheritance, and operator overloading.

The name "C++" is derived from the "++" operator, which in C and C++ means incrementing a value. The name symbolizes an evolution of C.

The first commercial C++ compiler, developed by AT&T, was released in 1985. This helped in the adoption of C++ in industry and academia.

Due to its popularity, years of evolution resulted in C++ being accepted and adopted on many different platforms (operating systems), most using their own C++ compilers. This evolution led to compiler-specific deviations and, therefore, interoperability problems and porting issues. Hence, there emerged a need to standardize the language and provide compiler manufacturers with a standard language specification to work with.

In 1998, the first standard version of C++ was ratified by the ISO Committee in ISO/IEC 14882:1998 and published as C++98. It defined the core features of the language, including the Standard Template Library (STL), which introduced data structures and algorithms for generic programming.

In 2003, the C++03 standard made minor improvements and clarifications to the language. It was an incremental update to C++98.

C++11, also known as C++0x during development, was publish in 2011 and introduced many significant features, such as lambda expressions, smart pointers, and a range of other improvements to the language. It marked a major evolution of C++.

C++ continued to evolve with new standards (C++14, C++17, C++20, etc.), introducing features like constexpr, concepts, parallelism, and more. These standards aimed to make the language more powerful, efficient, and expressive.
