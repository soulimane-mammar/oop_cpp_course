[//]: # (### Using the assert Macro to Validate Expressions)

The `assert` macro  is a  tool used to validate conditions or expressions at runtime and assists in detecting logical errors early in the program.

### Purpose of `assert` Macro

- **Runtime Assertions:** It's primarily used during development and debugging to check if certain conditions hold true at runtime.
- **Debugging Aid:** Helps programmers find logical errors by halting the program if an assertion fails.

### Syntax

```cpp
#include <cassert>

assert(expression);
```

`expression` is expected to be true. If false, the program halts.

#### Example Usage

```cpp
#include <cassert>

int divide(int a, int b) {
    // Ensure 'b' is not zero before division
    assert(b != 0); // Assertion to check if 'b' is not zero
    return a / b;
}

int main() {
    int result = divide(10, 0); // Assertion failure, program halts
    return 0;
}
```

Output using `g++`

```
test: test.cpp:5: int divide(int, int): Assertion `b != 0' failed.
Aborted (core dumped)
```

#### Key Points

- If the expression passed to `assert` evaluates to false (zero), the program halts, and an error message is typically displayed.
- Assertions are commonly used to verify preconditions, postconditions, or invariants within functions or parts of the code.
- Assertions are usually disabled in release builds (`NDEBUG` is defined) to avoid unnecessary overhead in production code.
