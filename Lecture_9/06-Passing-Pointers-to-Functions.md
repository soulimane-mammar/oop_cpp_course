[//]: # (### Passing Pointers to Functions)

Passing pointers to functions in C++ allows you to manipulate data outside the scope of the function and modify the original data directly, rather than working with copies. This is particularly useful when dealing with large amounts of data or when you want to modify the original data within a function.

Here's an example of passing a pointer to a function:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void modifyValue(int* ptr) {
    *ptr = 20; // Modifying the value at the address pointed by ptr
}

int main() {
    int x = 10;
    cout << "Before function call: " << x << endl;

    modifyValue(&x); // Passing the address of x to the function

    cout << "After function call: " << x << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example:

- `modifyValue(int* ptr)` is a function that takes a pointer to an integer as its parameter.
- `*ptr = 20;` modifies the value at the address pointed by `ptr`.

When you pass the address of `x` to `modifyValue` using `modifyValue(&x)`, it modifies the value of `x` directly inside the function.

#### Passing Pointers for Efficiency

Passing pointers instead of the actual data is more memory-efficient, especially when dealing with large data structures, as it avoids making copies of the entire data.

#### Precautions

- When passing pointers, ensure the pointer is valid (i.e., not a null pointer) before dereferencing it within the function to prevent potential runtime errors.
- Be careful with pointer arithmetic within functions to avoid going out of bounds of allocated memory.
