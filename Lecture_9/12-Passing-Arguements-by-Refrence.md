[//]: # (###Passing Arguments by Reference to Functions)

Passing arguments by reference to functions in C++ allows you to modify the original variables inside the function, avoiding the overhead of making copies. It's particularly useful when working with large objects or when you need to modify variables within a function and retain those modifications outside the function.

#### Syntax for Passing Arguments by Reference

To pass arguments by reference, use the reference symbol (`&`) in the function declaration

##### Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void modifyValue(int &val) {
    val *= 2; // Modifying the original variable through reference
}

int main() {
    int num = 10;
    cout << "Original value: " << num << endl; // Output: Original value: 10

    modifyValue(num); // Passing by reference
    cout << "Modified value: " << num << endl; // Output: Modified value: 20

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `modifyValue` takes an `int` argument by reference. When `num` is passed to `modifyValue`, it modifies `num` directly inside the function, and those modifications are visible outside the function in the `main` function, demonstrating the direct modification capability of passing by reference.

#### Characteristics of Passing by Reference

1. **Direct Modification:** The function operates directly on the original variable passed to it, allowing modifications to the variable.

2. **Memory Efficiency:** Passing by reference avoids making copies of large objects or data structures, improving memory efficiency.
