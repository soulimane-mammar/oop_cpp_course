[//]: # (### Singleton Class That Permits a Single Instance)

A singleton is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to a single instance and provides global access to that instance. To achieve this, you can create a class with a private constructor, a static member function to access the single instance, and a static member variable to hold that instance.

#### Example of a Singleton Class

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Singleton {
private:
    // Private constructor to prevent external instantiation
    Singleton() {}

    // Static reference to hold the single instance
    static Singleton& instance;

public:
    // Static member function to access the single instance
    static Singleton& getInstance() {
        static Singleton instance; // Instantiating the singleton object
        return instance;
    }

    // Method to demonstrate the singleton instance
    void showMessage() {
        cout << "Singleton instance created!" << endl;
    }
};

// Initializing the static member reference
Singleton& Singleton::instance = Singleton::getInstance();

int main() {
    // Accessing the singleton instance using reference
    Singleton& obj1 = Singleton::getInstance();
    obj1.showMessage(); // Output: Singleton instance created!

    // Attempting to create another instance using reference
    Singleton& obj2 = Singleton::getInstance();
    obj2.showMessage(); 

    // Checking if both references refer to the same instance
    if (&obj1 == &obj2) {
        cout << "Both references refer to the same instance!" << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "Error: Different instances!" << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}

```

In this example:

- The Singleton class uses a static reference instance to hold the single instance.
- The `getInstance()` method returns a reference to the singleton instance.
- Both `obj1` and `obj2` are references to the same singleton instance, ensuring that only one instance exists throughout the program's execution.

Singletons are often used in scenarios where there should be only one instance of a class, such as global configuration settings, logging, database connections, or resource managers, ensuring a single point of access throughout the application. However, note that singletons can introduce global state and might impact testability and flexibility in some cases, so use them judiciously based on the requirements.
