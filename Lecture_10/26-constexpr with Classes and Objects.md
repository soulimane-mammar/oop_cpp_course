[//]: # (### constexpr with Classes and Objects)

In C++, the `constexpr` specifier is used to indicate that an object, function, or variable can be evaluated at compile-time. When applied to classes and their member functions, `constexpr` implies that certain operations can be performed during compilation, enabling more efficient code execution.

#### `constexpr` with Classes

##### Example with a Class and `constexpr` Constructor

```cpp
class Circle {
private:
    double radius;

public:
    constexpr Circle(double r) : radius(r) {}

    constexpr double getArea() const {
        return 3.14159 * radius * radius;
    }
};

int main() {
    constexpr Circle c(5.0); // Creating a constexpr object at compile-time
    constexpr double area = c.getArea(); // Calculating area at compile-time

    return 0;
}
```

- In this example, the `Circle` class has a `constexpr` constructor that allows creating `constexpr` objects at compile-time.
- The `getArea()` member function is also marked as `constexpr`, enabling computations like calculating the area at compile-time for `constexpr` objects.
- Using `constexpr` with classes allows for computations to be performed at compile-time when possible, improving performance and allowing more optimizations.
