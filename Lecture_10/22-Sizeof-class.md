[//]: # (### Using sizeof with a Class)

In C++, you can use the `sizeof()` operator to determine the size of a class, which includes the size of its member variables along with any padding that might be added by the compiler for alignment purposes.

Here's an example demonstrating the use of `sizeof()` with a class:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class MyClass {
private:
    int number;
    char character;
    double floating;

public:
    void displaySize() {
        cout << "Size of MyClass: " << sizeof(MyClass) << " bytes" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    MyClass obj;
    obj.displaySize();

    return 0;
}
```

In this example:

- The `MyClass` class contains three member variables: an `int`, a `char`, and a `double`.
- The `displaySize()` member function of `MyClass` uses the `sizeof()` operator to output the size of the `MyClass` object.
- In the `main()` function, an object `obj` of type `MyClass` is created, and its `displaySize()` function is called to print the size of the `MyClass` object.

Keep in mind that the size calculated by `sizeof()` includes any padding added by the compiler for alignment purposes, and it might vary based on the system architecture and compiler settings.

Here's another example of a class with a member attribute that points to dynamically allocated memory, along with using `sizeof()` to determine the overall size of the class.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class DynamicMemory {
private:
    int* dynamicData;

public:
    // Constructor to allocate dynamic memory
    DynamicMemory() {
        dynamicData = new int[5]; // Allocating an array of 5 integers
    }

    // Destructor to free allocated memory
    ~DynamicMemory() {
        delete[] dynamicData;
    }

    void displaySize() {
        // displays 4 in a 32bit architecture and 8 in a 64bit architecture
        cout << "Size of DynamicMemory: " << sizeof(*this) << " bytes" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    DynamicMemory obj;
    obj.displaySize();

    return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

- The `DynamicMemory` class has a private member attribute `dynamicData`, which is a pointer to an array of 5 integers.
- In the constructor, memory is dynamically allocated for the `dynamicData` array using `new[]`.
- The destructor `~DynamicMemory()` deallocates the dynamically allocated memory using `delete[]` to prevent memory leaks.
- The `displaySize()` member function uses `sizeof(*this)` to display the size of the `DynamicMemory` object, which includes the size of the pointer member (`dynamicData`) and any other potential padding or overhead.

Remember, the size calculated by `sizeof()` includes the size of the member variables but doesn't account for the actual memory pointed to by dynamically allocated pointers. **It reflects the size of the class object itself, not the size of the dynamically allocated memory pointed to by its members.**
