[//]: # (### The Keywords public and private)

In C++, the keywords `public` and `private` are access specifiers used within classes to control the visibility of class members (attributes and methods) from outside the class. They define the access levels for these members, determining which parts of the program can access them.

#### public

- **Accessible Everywhere:** Members declared under the `public` access specifier are accessible from outside the class, including from other classes and functions.
- **Interface of the Class:** Public members form the interface of the class, allowing users to interact with the class's objects through these accessible members.
- **Example:**
  
  ```cpp
  class Car {
  public:
      string make; // Public attribute accessible from outside the class
      void startEngine() { /* Method accessible from outside the class */ }
  };
  ```

#### private

- **Restricted Access:** Members declared under the `private` access specifier are only accessible from within the class itself. They are hidden from the outside world, including other classes and functions.
- **Encapsulation:** Private members encapsulate the internal state of the class, ensuring data integrity and hiding implementation details.
- **Example:**

  ```cpp
  class Car {
  private:
      int enginePower; // Private attribute accessible only within the class
      void increasePower() { /* Method accessible only within the class */ }
  };
  ```

#### Access Control

- **Default Access Specifier:** The default access specifier for class members in C++ is `private`. If not explicitly specified, members are private by default.
- **Changing Access Specifiers:** Access specifiers can be changed multiple times within a class. Once changed, the access level remains until another access specifier is encountered.
- **Access Within the Same Class:** All members can access other members within the same class regardless of their access specifiers.

#### Importance

- **Encapsulation and Information Hiding:** Public and private access specifiers are crucial for encapsulation, allowing the class to hide its internal state and only expose necessary functionality.
- **Code Security:** They contribute to code security by restricting direct access to sensitive class members, preventing unintended modifications or corruption of data.
