[//]: # (### The this Pointer)

The `this` pointer in C++ is a special pointer that holds the address of the current object. It's an implicit parameter passed to non-static member functions and represents the object on which the member function is being called.

#### Key Points about the `this` Pointer

1. **Contextual Reference:** Inside a member function, `this` refers to the address of the object for which the function is invoked. It allows access to the object's member variables and methods.

2. **Automatically Available:** The `this` pointer is implicitly available within non-static member functions. You don't need to explicitly declare it; it's automatically available for use.

3. **Accessing Members:** Using `this->memberName` allows differentiation between local variables and member variables when they have the same name. It helps resolve ambiguity within member functions.

#### Example Demonstrating the `this` Pointer

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Example {
private:
    int value;

public:
    Example(int val) : value(val) {}

    void displayValue() {
        // No need to use  the 'this' pointer to access member variable
        // There no ambiguity 
        cout << "Value using this pointer: " << value << endl;
    }

    void compareValue(int value) {
        // Comparing parameter 'value' with the member variable 'value' using 'this'
        // Here we need to use the 'this' parameter to 
        // distinguish between the parameter 'value' and the member variable 'value'
        if (value == this->value) {
            cout << "Parameter value matches the object's value." << endl;
        } else {
            cout << "Parameter value does not match the object's value." << endl;
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    Example obj1(10);
    Example obj2(20);

    obj1.displayValue(); // Output: Value using this pointer: 10
    obj2.displayValue(); // Output: Value using this pointer: 20

    obj1.compareValue(15); // Output: Parameter value does not match the object's value.
    obj2.compareValue(20); // Output: Parameter value matches the object's value.

    return 0;
}
```

In this example:

- The `this` pointer is used in the  `compareValue()` member functions to access the `value` member variable of each object.
- It helps differentiate between the local `value` parameter and the `value` member variable within the `compareValue()` method.
- `this->value` refers to the `value` member of the object on which the function is called.
