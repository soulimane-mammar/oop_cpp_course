[//]: # (####Comments in C++ Code)

Comments in C++ are used to provide explanatory notes within the source code. These comments are ignored by the compiler and are intended for human readers to better understand the code. There are two main types of comments in C++:

1. **Single-line comments:**
   - Denoted by `//`.
   - Anything following `//` on the same line is treated as a comment.

   ```cpp
   // This is a single-line comment
   int x = 10; // This is an inline comment
   ```

2. **Multi-line comments:**
   - Enclosed between `/*` and `*/`.
   - Can span multiple lines.

   ```cpp
   /*
   This is a multi-line comment
   It can span several lines
   */
   int y = 20;
   ```

Comments are useful for providing context, explanations, or reminders to yourself or others who might read the code. They contribute to code readability and can be crucial for understanding the purpose or functionality of specific code segments. However, it's important not to overuse comments or leave outdated comments, as they may lead to confusion. Well-written and concise comments enhance the maintainability and collaboration aspects of code.
