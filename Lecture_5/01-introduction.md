[//]: # (### Introduction)

In previous lessons, you declared variables used to contain a single `int`, `char`, or `string`, to
mention a few instances. However, you may want to declare a collection of objects, such as
20 ints or a string of characters to hold a name.
In this lesson, you learn
• What arrays are and how to declare and use them
• What strings are and how to use character arrays to make them
• A brief introduction to `std::string`
