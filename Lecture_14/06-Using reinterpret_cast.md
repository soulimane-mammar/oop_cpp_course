[//]: # (### Using reinterpret_cast)

`reinterpret_cast` is a type of casting operator in C++ that converts one pointer type to another, even if the data types before and after conversion are different. It does not check if the pointer type and the data pointed by the pointer is the same or not.

The syntax of `reinterpret_cast` is as follows:

```cpp
reinterpret_cast<data_type *>(pointer_variable);
```

Here's an example of how `reinterpret_cast` is used:

```cpp
int* p = new int(65);
char* ch = reinterpret_cast<char*>(p);
cout << *p << endl; // Outputs: 65
cout << *ch << endl; // Outputs: A
cout << p << endl; // Outputs: Address of p
cout << ch << endl; // Outputs: Address of ch
```

In this example, an integer pointer `p` is pointing to the memory location holding the integer value 65. Then, `reinterpret_cast` is used to create a character pointer `ch` that points to the same memory location. Since the size of `int` and `char` are different, the output of `*ch` is 'A' (on a little endian architecture), which is the ASCII character corresponding to the integer 65.

However, `reinterpret_cast` is a very special and potentially dangerous type of casting operator. It's recommended to use it carefully, as it can lead to non-portable code if used improperly. It's often used to interface with opaque data types in vendor APIs over which the programmer has no control.
It's worth noting that `reinterpret_cast` does not change the value of a pointer. Performing a class member access that designates a non-static data member or a non-static member function on a glvalue that does not actually designate an object of the appropriate type - such as one obtained through a `reinterpret_cast` - results in undefined behavior.
