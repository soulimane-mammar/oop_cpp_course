The next step is to click on “Create a new Xcode project”.
If you have an existing project you will click on “Open a project or file” or “Clone an existing project” if the project is on source control.
Next, click on the macOS tab and then click on the Command-Line app as it is the only thing where we can develop apps in C and C++

It will now show an interface to give the app a name and the package name. After giving that name there would be a drop-down to select a language. So, instead of swift, you can select C or C++ and click Next

Then it will ask for the location of the project on your machine
Then, you can open or create a C or C++ file and start editing it
