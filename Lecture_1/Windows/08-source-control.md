[//]: # (## Source control)

Most if not all of the development workflow involves using `Git`.
Also, some of CMake's functionalities requires Git to be installed.
And you also need Git to install `vcpkg`.
You can install `Git` either by using the installer or using a package manager, like `MSYS2` which we just used above to install `GCC` and `Clang`.

- Install by using the installer
   Download the installer <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/win" target="_blank"> here </a> and then it can be installed by keep clicking `Next`.
