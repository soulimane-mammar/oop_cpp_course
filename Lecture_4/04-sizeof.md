[//]: # (### Determining the Size of a Variable by Using sizeof)

In C++, the `sizeof()` operator helps determine the size, in bytes, of a variable or a data type. It's a unary operator that returns the amount of memory allocated to a type or a variable in the current compiler or platform.

Here's how you can use `sizeof()`:

#### For Data Types

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Size of int: " << sizeof(int) << " bytes" << endl;
    cout << "Size of double: " << sizeof(double) << " bytes" << endl;
    cout << "Size of char: " << sizeof(char) << " byte" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

This code snippet prints the sizes of `int`, `double`, and `char` in bytes.

#### For Variables

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int num = 10;
    double value = 3.14;
    
    cout << "Size of num: " << sizeof(num) << " bytes" << endl;
    cout << "Size of value: " << sizeof(value) << " bytes" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `sizeof()` is used to determine the sizes of the `num` and `value` variables.

#### For Custom Types

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

struct MyStruct {
    int a;
    double b;
    char c;
};

int main() {
    MyStruct myVar;
    cout << "Size of myVar: " << sizeof(myVar) << " bytes" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

This snippet shows how to use `sizeof()` to find the size of a custom-defined `struct` named `MyStruct`.

Keep in mind that the size returned by `sizeof()` might vary depending on the compiler, platform, and architecture. The size of types might be different on different systems. Additionally, `sizeof()` returns the size in bytes.
