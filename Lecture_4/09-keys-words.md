[//]: # (Keywords You Cannot Use as Variable or Constant
Names)

In C++, there are certain keywords that have special meanings and are reserved for specific purposes. You cannot use these keywords as variable names, constant names, or identifiers in your code because they are already predefined for specific language constructs. Some of these keywords include:

1. **Reserved Keywords:**
    - `int`, `float`, `double`, `char`, `bool`: These are fundamental data types.
    - `if`, `else`, `while`, `for`, `switch`, `case`, `break`, `continue`: Keywords used for control flow.
    - `return`: Used to return values from functions.
    - `class`, `struct`, `enum`: Used to define user-defined types.
    - `const`, `constexpr`, `static`: Keywords used for defining constants or specifying storage duration.
    - `namespace`, `using`: Keywords related to namespaces and using declarations.
    - `virtual`, `override`, `final`: Keywords used in object-oriented programming for inheritance and polymorphism.
    - `sizeof`, `typeid`: Keywords used for obtaining information about types.

2. **Reserved Literals:**
    - `true`, `false`: Boolean literals.
    - `nullptr`: Pointer literal representing a null pointer.
    - `static_assert`: Used for compile-time assertions.
    - `alignas`, `alignof`: Keywords related to memory alignment.

3. **Others:**
    - `auto`: Used for automatic type deduction.
    - `register`: Historically used to suggest that a variable should be stored in a register, but its usage and impact are implementation-dependent in modern C++.

Attempting to use these reserved keywords as variable or constant names will result in compilation errors or unexpected behavior because they are already defined by the language for specific purposes. It's good practice to avoid using these reserved keywords as identifiers in your code to prevent conflicts and improve code readability.
