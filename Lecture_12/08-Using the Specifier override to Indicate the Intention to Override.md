[//]: # (### Using the Specifier override to Indicate the Intention to Override)

The `override` specifier is used to explicitly indicate that a member function in a derived class is intended to override a virtual function from a base class. It helps catch potential errors at compile-time by ensuring that the function signature in the derived class matches the one in the base class.

Here's an example demonstrating the use of `override`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Base {
public:
    virtual void display() const {
        cout << "Base Display" << endl;
    }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void display() const override {  // Using 'override'
        cout << "Derived Display" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Derived derived;
    Base* basePtr = &derived;

    basePtr->display();  // Calls Derived's display() due to override

    return 0;
}
```

Explanation:

- `Base` class has a virtual function `display()`.
- `Derived` class overrides `display()` from `Base`.
- In `Derived`, `display()` is marked with `override` specifier, indicating that it overrides a base class function.
- If there is a mismatch in the function signature (e.g., wrong parameter types), the compiler will generate an error, indicating that the function does not override a base class function.
- Using `override` helps maintain code correctness by explicitly specifying the intention to override a function from the base class.
