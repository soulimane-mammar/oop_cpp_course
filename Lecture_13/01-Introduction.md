[//]: # (### Introduction)

In addition to encapsulating data and methods, a class can also encapsulate operators that make it easy to operate on instances of the class. You can use these operators to perform operations such as assignment or addition on class objects similar to those on integers. Just like functions, operators can also be overloaded.

In this lesson, you learn:

- Using the keyword operator
- Unary and binary operators
- Conversion operators
- The move assignment operator
- Operators that cannot be redefined
