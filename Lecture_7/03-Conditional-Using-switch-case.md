[//]: # (###Conditional Processing Using switch-case)

The `switch` statement in C++ provides a means for conditional branching based on the value of an expression. It evaluates the expression and executes code blocks based on matching cases. Here's an overview of `switch...case`:

#### Syntax

```cpp
switch (expression) {
    case constant1:
        // Code to execute if expression matches constant1
        break; // Optional, used to exit the switch block
    case constant2:
        // Code to execute if expression matches constant2
        break;
    // More cases...
    default:
        // Code to execute if none of the cases match
}
```

#### Example

```cpp
int choice = 2;

switch (choice) {
    case 1:
        cout << "You chose 1" << endl;
        break;
    case 2:
        cout << "You chose 2" << endl;
        break;
    case 3:
        cout << "You chose 3" << endl;
        break;
    default:
        cout << "Invalid choice" << endl;
}
```

#### Explanation

- The `switch` statement evaluates the `expression` and matches it against the `case` constants.
- If a `case` constant matches the value of the `expression`, the code block for that case executes.
- The `break` statement is used to exit the `switch` block after executing a case. Without `break`, execution continues to the next case.
- `default` is optional and executes if no `case` matches the value of the `expression`.

#### Use Cases

- `switch` is efficient for checking a single variable against multiple values.
- It provides a cleaner alternative to multiple nested `if...else` statements.

#### Considerations

- Each `case` value must be a constant expression of the same data type as the `switch` expression.
- `break` statements are crucial to prevent fall-through to subsequent cases.
